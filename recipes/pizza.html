    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <h4>Dough:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (.25 ounce) envelope active dry yeast </li>
        <li>1 cup lukewarm water</li>
        <li>3 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons shortening</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Sauce:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (6 ounce) can tomato paste</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon dried oregano</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
        <li>¾ cup water</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon dried basil</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Cheese:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (12 ounce) package shredded mozzarella cheese, or to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients</li>
        <li>Make the dough: Dissolve yeast in lukewarm water in a small bowl. Let stand until creamy, about 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Combine flour, shortening, and salt in a large bowl; add yeast mixture and stir until dough comes together. Knead dough on a lightly floured surface until smooth and elastic, about 8 minutes.</li>
        <li>Lightly oil a large bowl. Place dough into the bowl and turn to coat with oil. Cover with a damp cloth and let rise in a warm place until doubled in volume, about 45 minutes.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, make the sauce: Heat oil in a small saucepan over medium heat. Add onion and sauté until tender, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Stir in tomato paste, water, salt, sugar, oregano, garlic powder, basil, marjoram, cumin, chili powder, red pepper flakes, and black pepper; simmer for 15 to 20 minutes</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Divide dough in half. Roll each half into a 12-inch circle. Place dough onto two 12-inch pizza pans; cover with sauce and mozzarella cheese.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until crusts are golden brown, about 20 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
